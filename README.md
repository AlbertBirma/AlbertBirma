 Hi there. Okay, no changes. 

I'm currently working with my Python code for development in data science and I publish my own experience in programming here - on GitHub.
So...
I'm trying to understand my own abilities and use it for my goals . I'm also learning foreign languages, biology and math for my future career in bioinbormatics.
